### What is this?
I'm learning Python/Pygame. This is just a small project to get used to making games using Python.
### Can I contribute?
Go ahead! I'm open to letting people improve upon my work.
### Am I able to use this for my own projects?
Yes, with credit. This isn't the best platformer engine for Python, but if it fits your needs, go ahead.
